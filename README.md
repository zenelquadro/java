The app features a graphical interface built with JavaFX and stores data in a PostgreSQL database. It also supports exporting records to JSON and CSV formats.

## Objectives
- Implement a fully functional Java application with a graphical user interface using JavaFX.
- Provide the ability to create, read, update, and delete waste collection records.
- Ensure data persistence using PostgreSQL for long-term storage of records.
- Include input validation and error handling for a smooth user experience.
- Add export functionality to allow data extraction in JSON and CSV formats.
- Design the code in a modular and maintainable way for future feature expansion.
